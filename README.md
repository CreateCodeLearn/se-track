# CreateCodeLearn Software Engineering Track
This is the central repository for the Software Engineering track. Resources will grow here over time.

## Setting Yourself Up

Here are a few basic things which can help on the way.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the version control system which forms the backbone of the open source community, and stores the code powering much of the world's technology. Make [yourself an account](https://github.com/), and join the world of programmers. Here's a [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) for  GitHub.

#### Websites for trying out coding
The first step can be a doozy, because it involves setting up your computer as a development environment. There are a few quick-start tools which allow you to try some basic things out _before_ setting up your computer. A few tools that may be useful for coding simple things in the browser are:

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/) for frontend (HTML, CSS, simple JS)  
[repl](https://repl.it/) Choose your language, e.g. Python,

##### Setup Your Computer
Get a code editor or IDE, like [atom](https://atom.io/). This is something like an advanced word processing editor, but for code instead of human languages. Atom has lots of plugins which assist in the coding of various languages.

- If you use OSX, installing Xcode from the App Store is the easiest way to turn your computer into a developer machine.

- If you are on a Linux Operating System, you probably know your way around a bit already.

- If you are on Windows, a variety of clients are available for dedicated programming languages.

## Resources for self-guided learning

The following is a handful of select, online resources for your self-guided study. The possibilities of both how and what to learn in software engineering are endless; these resources are meant as a place to begin your journey. The best way to learn programming is by _doing_, which is why these resources focus on tutorials.

**Introductory Tutorial on Programming**  
[Learn Programming Fundamentals using Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)

**Introduction to Javascript**  
[Intro to Javascript](https://javascript.info/)

**Relational Databases Intro**
Learn about Relational Databases and SQL in particular with this [MySQL tutorial](http://www.mysqltutorial.org/basic-mysql-tutorial.aspx)

**Single Page Web Applications & React.js**
Many modern website are using Javascript frameworks such as React.js. [Here is a nice blog post](https://medium.com/in-the-weeds/learning-react-with-create-react-app-part-1-a12e1833fdc) about a relatively painless way to get started with React.

**Learn About Algorithms: Validate a credit card number**.
Use the instructions on the top part of this page (under "Background") [here](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/psets/1/credit/credit.html), skipping the "Specifications" part, and the rest. You can try this in any language, and put it on GitHub & share on slack.
