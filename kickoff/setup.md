## Setting Yourself Up for Development

Here are a few steps to set yourself up to start on software engineering.


##### Start by setting up and learning a bit about git & github:

- [Make yourself an account on GitHub](https://github.com/join)
- Send one of the coaches a PM on slack with your GitHub name, so you can be added to the CreateCodeLearn GitHub organization.
- [Install git on your machine](https://linode.com/docs/development/version-control/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/)
- [Do a Hello World github example (in the browser)](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

##### Next, set up your file editor:

- [Download the Atom code editor](https://atom.io/)

##### Now, use git & github from within Atom:

-  Open the git and github tabs in atom, login to github.
- Building off of the `hello-world` repository which you made in [the tutorial above](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), clone/download the repository onto your computer, open it in Atom, make some changes, then Stage, Commit, and push to GitHub using Atom. Go to the browser, and check that it worked the way you expected it to.

#### Contribute to our very own open-source python chatbot

OK, now you're ready to contribute to our very own chatbot!

1.  [Clone into this repository](https://github.com/CreateCodeLearn/se-track), and open the chatbot folder/project in Atom.

2.  Expand on the functionality of the chatbot. Think about adding responses to the bot, or asking more questions, or anything else you would like to see here!

  _hint: you might want to try adding the [python tools ](https://atom.io/packages/python-tools) package to atom to help you coding python_

3.  If you are doing a larger "feature", think about using a branch - allowing you to develop in parallel to others. If you are doing a tiny change, like the wording of a response, think about committing directly to the master branch.

  _hint: try adding a function and call it in main()_
